## Desktop Wallpapers

Wallpapers are a crucial part of any desktop. Some people prefer live wallpapers, while others opt for static images.

### Live Wallpapers

1. **Wallpaper Engine**: It's simple, beautiful, and offers a wide variety of themes, but it's a paid software and doesn't have open-source code.

    To install, you'll need [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) (you don't need to run Steam before launching the program). Search for "Wallpaper Engine" or click [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/).

2. **Lively Wallpaper**: It's free and open-source, though it comes with only around 12 default themes upon installation. However, you can [find](https://www.google.com/search?q=lively+wallpaper+wallpapers) many themes for this program online, which you can install by dragging video files into the program window.

    You can download the program from [GitHub](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively) or the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NTM2QC6QWS7?cid=storebadge&ocid=badge).

### Scheduled Wallpaper Changes

1. **WinDynamicDesktop**: This open-source tool smoothly changes wallpapers based on the time of day. After installing, you can choose default themes or [download others](https://windd.info/themes/).

    You can download the program from [GitHub](https://github.com/t1m0thyj/WinDynamicDesktop) or the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nm8n7dq3z5f?cid=storebadge&ocid=badge).


## Widgets

1. **JaxCore**: This is a theme for [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) that adds numerous widgets to your desktop and replaces the standard Windows overlay.

    For example, when you adjust the volume using media keys, you'll see:

    <figure>
        <img class="content__figure" src="images/1.jpg" alt="Windows Volume Slider">
        <figcaption>Windows Volume Slider</figcaption>
    </figure>


    If you use one of the JaxCore widgets, it will look something like this:

    <figure>
        <img class="content__figure" src="images/2.jpg" alt="Volume Slider in a JaxCore Theme - Amber">
        <figcaption>Volume Slider in a JaxCore Theme - Amber</figcaption>
    </figure>

    Or like this:

    <figure>
        <img class="content__figure" src="images/3.jpg" alt="JaxCore Volume Slider - Gnome Theme">
        <figcaption>JaxCore Volume Slider - Gnome Theme</figcaption>
    </figure>

    You can customize almost everything in the settings: font, widget accent color, animation duration, background, and more.

## Taskbar

1. **RoundedTB**: This utility allows you to round the corners of the Windows taskbar. It's free and can be downloaded from either the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/roundedtb/9MTFTXSJ9M7F?) or [GitHub](https://github.com/torchgm/RoundedTB).

    The program's interface is user-friendly and allows you to configure the taskbar as you like.

    Upon opening the program, you'll see two sliders. The first adjusts padding on all sides, allowing you to create rounded corners and bottom padding. The second slider controls the degree of rounding; my settings are 4 and 8, resulting in this effect:

    <figure>
        <img class="content__figure" src="images/4.jpg" alt="My Taskbar">
        <figcaption>My Taskbar</figcaption>
    </figure>

    There's an "Advanced" button in the RoundedTB interface that reveals even more settings.

    "Dynamic Mode" opens two checkboxes. Enabling "Show Win + F2 Taskbar" adds the ability to display the system tray, which includes open programs, language, and time, when pressing Win + F2. "Show tray on hover" does the same but activates when you hover over the tray area.

    The fourth checkbox integrates RoundedTB and TranslucentTB, which will be discussed in the next paragraph.

    The fifth checkbox displays the entire taskbar when any application is in full-screen mode.

    The sixth checkbox does the same as the fifth but shows the taskbar when Alt + Tab is pressed, ensuring no bottom padding when switching tabs.

    P.S. If you want to make the rounded taskbar protrude, simply specifying this in the system settings isn't enough. In the advanced settings, set top padding to 0 and the desired value for other sides.

2. **TranslucentTB**: This utility lets you choose various themes for the taskbar, adding a slight blur to the background and removing darkening.
